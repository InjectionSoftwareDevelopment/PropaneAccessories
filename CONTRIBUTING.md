# Contribution Guide for PropaneAccessories

The contribution guide for the PropaneAccessories repo is basically the same as the guide for the core Propane repo, *with a few extra rules.*


1. Only open merge requests for PropAcc's that have issues
2. Do **NOT** use issues to request PropAcc's
3. ***DO NOT USE ISSUES TO REQUEST PropAcc's!!! (We say it twice because we really mean it, please don't do it!)***
4. Name your branch name the same as your PropAcc if possible
5. Follow the Propane CONTRIBUTION.md guide: [Propane Contribution Guide](https://github.com/InjectionSoftwareDevelopment/Propane/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
